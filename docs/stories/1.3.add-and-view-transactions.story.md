# Story 1.3: Add and View Transactions

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to add new income and expense transactions to a specific account and see them in a monthly list,
**so that** I can track my financial activity and see my account balances update in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The database schema for a "Transactions" table is created and linked to the "Accounts" table.
2. A backend API endpoint exists to create a new transaction (requiring amount, type, and account ID).
3. A backend API endpoint exists to fetch all transactions for the current month.
4. The UI provides a form to add a new transaction, including fields for amount, type (income/expense), and selecting the parent account.
5. When a transaction is successfully added, the balance of the associated account is correctly recalculated and updated in the UI.
6. The transaction list view correctly displays the new transaction.

## Dev Notes

This story implements the transaction creation and viewing functionality for the Personal Wallet App. The following technical details are extracted from the architecture documents:

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.2, the Accounts table and API endpoints are already established. The transaction functionality will build upon this foundation by linking transactions to existing accounts.

### Database Schema
- **Table Name:** transactions
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT cuid() - Unique identifier for the transaction
  - `amount`: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL - The monetary value of the transaction
  - `type`: TEXT NOT NULL - Either 'income' or 'expense'
  - `description`: TEXT - Optional user-provided note about the transaction
  - `account_id`: TEXT NOT NULL - Foreign key reference to accounts table
  - `category_id`: TEXT NOT NULL - Foreign key reference to categories table (will use default category for now)
  - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL
- **Foreign Key Constraints:**
  - `account_id` references `accounts(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
  - `category_id` references `categories(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
- **Indexes:** Create indexes on `account_id` and `category_id` for faster lookups
[Source: architecture.md#database-schema]

### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/transactions**
  - Returns a list of all transactions for the current month
  - Response: Array of Transaction objects
- **POST /api/transactions**
  - Creates a new transaction
  - Request Body: NewTransaction object (amount, type, description, accountId, categoryId)
  - Response: Created Transaction object
  - Must recalculate and update account balance
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

### Data Models
- **Transaction Interface:**
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  description?: string | null;
  accountId: string;
  categoryId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```
- **NewTransaction Interface:**
```typescript
interface NewTransaction {
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  description?: string;
  accountId: string;
  categoryId: string;
}
```
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

### Frontend Components
- **Component Location:** Transaction-specific components in `/components/features/transactions`
  - Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui in `/components/ui`
- **State Management:** Use Zustand for global state management
  - Create a transaction store slice for managing transaction state
  - Update account store to reflect balance changes
- **Form Handling:** Use React Hook Form for transaction form management and validation
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

### File Locations

- **API Routes:** `/app/api/transactions/route.ts` for GET and POST endpoints
- **Components:** `/components/features/transactions/` for transaction-specific components

- **Balance Calculation:** Implement server-side balance calculation logic that accounts for all transactions
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for transaction creation and retrieval API routes
- Unit tests for transaction form validation
- Component tests for the Transaction List and Add Transaction form components
- Integration tests for account balance calculation logic
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

### Project Structure Notes

## Testing
- Unit tests for transaction creation and retrieval API routes
- Unit tests for the Transaction form validation and balance calculation logic
- Component tests for the Transaction List and Add Transaction form components
- Integration tests to verify account balance updates correctly when transactions are added
