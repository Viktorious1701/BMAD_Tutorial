# Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Deployment Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Next.js project, connect it to a GitHub repository, and configure a CI/CD pipeline with Netlify,
**so that** I have a foundational, deployable codebase from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js application is created on the local machine.
2. The project is successfully pushed to a new repository on GitHub.
3. The GitHub repository is connected to a new site on Netlify.
4. A basic "Hello World" or index page, when pushed to the main branch on GitHub, automatically triggers a deployment and becomes live on the Netlify URL.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize a new Next.js project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Use `create-next-app` to create a new Next.js application
  - [ ] Configure the project with TypeScript support
  - [ ] Configure the project with Tailwind CSS for styling
  - [ ] Install shadcn/ui as the component library
  - [ ] Create a basic "Hello World" or index page
- [ ] Set up version control with Git (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Initialize a Git repository
  - [ ] Create a .gitignore file with appropriate entries
  - [ ] Make an initial commit with the base project
  - [ ] Create a new repository on GitHub
  - [ ] Connect the local repository to the GitHub repository
  - [ ] Push the initial commit to GitHub
- [ ] Configure Netlify deployment (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create a new site on Netlify
  - [ ] Connect the Netlify site to the GitHub repository
  - [ ] Configure build settings for Next.js
  - [ ] Trigger an initial deployment
  - [ ] Verify the deployment is successful and the site is live

## Dev Notes

This story establishes the foundation for the Personal Wallet App project. The following technical details are extracted from the architecture documents:

### Project Setup
- **Framework:** Next.js (version ~14.1.0) [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Language:** TypeScript (version ~5.3.3) [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (version ~3.4.1) [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **UI Component Library:** shadcn/ui (latest) [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]

### Repository Structure
- **Structure:** Monorepo [Source: architecture.md#Repository Structure]
- **Package Organization:** All code (frontend, backend API routes, shared types) will reside within the single Next.js application structure created by `create-next-app` [Source: architecture.md#Repository Structure]

### Deployment Configuration
- **Platform:** Netlify [Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]
- **CI/CD:** Netlify's built-in Continuous Integration and Deployment from a GitHub repository [Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]
- **Serverless Functions:** Netlify Functions will be used to deploy the Next.js API Routes [Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

### Testing
The project will include unit tests for critical business logic and components. While comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing is not in scope for the MVP, the testing structure should be established to allow for future expansion. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]

## Testing
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest (version ~1.2.2) for unit and component testing [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright (version ~1.41.2) for end-to-end testing of critical user flows [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Test Location:** Tests should be co-located with the components they test [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
