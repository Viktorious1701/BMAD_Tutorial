# Story 1.2: Account Creation and Viewing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to create financial accounts with a name and starting balance and see a list of my accounts,
**so that** I can set up the different wallets where my money is managed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The database schema for an "Accounts" table (with columns for name, starting balance, etc.) is created.
2. A backend API endpoint exists to create a new account.
3. A backend API endpoint exists to retrieve a list of all created accounts.
4. A user interface is created with a form to input a new account's name and starting balance.
5. Submitting the form successfully calls the create API and adds the new account to the database.
6. The UI displays a list of all created accounts.

  - [x] Create a migration script to create the Accounts table
  - [x] Run the migration to create the table in the database
- [x] Implement backend API endpoints (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create API route for creating a new account (`POST /api/accounts`)
  - [x] Create API route for retrieving all accounts (`GET /api/accounts`)
  - [x] Implement validation for account creation inputs
  - [x] Add error handling for API routes
- [x] Create UI components for account management (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Create an "Add Account" form component with fields for name and starting balance
  - [x] Create an "Account List" component to display all accounts
  - [x] Implement form validation for the Add Account form
  - [x] Connect the form submission to the create account API endpoint
  - [x] Connect the Account List component to the get accounts API endpoint
  - [x] Add loading and error states for API interactions
- [x] Create account management page
  - [x] Create a dedicated page for account management
  - [x] Integrate the Add Account form and Account List components
  - [x] Implement real-time updates when a new account is added

## Dev Notes

This story implements the account creation and viewing functionality for the Personal Wallet App. The following technical details are extracted from the architecture documents:

### Database Schema
- **Table Name:** accounts
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT cuid() - Unique identifier for the account
  - `name`: TEXT NOT NULL - Name of the account
  - `starting_balance`: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00 - Initial balance of the account
  - `user_id`: TEXT - For future multi-user support (not used in MVP)
  - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL

### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/accounts**
  - Returns a list of all accounts
  - Response: Array of Account objects
- **POST /api/accounts**
  - Creates a new account
  - Request Body: NewAccount object (name, startingBalance)
  - Response: Created Account object

### Data Models
- **Account Interface:**
```typescript
interface Account {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  startingBalance: number;
}
```
- **NewAccount Interface:**
```typescript
interface NewAccount {
  name: string;
  startingBalance: number;
}
```

### Frontend Components
- **Component Location:** Components should be organized in a feature-based structure
  - Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui in `/components/ui`
  - Account-specific components in `/components/features/accounts`
- **State Management:** Use Zustand for global state management
  - Create an account store slice for managing account state

### Routing
- **Page Location:** `/app/accounts/page.tsx` for the accounts management page

## Testing
- Unit tests for account creation and retrieval API routes
- Unit tests for the Account form validation
- Component tests for the Account List and Add Account form components
