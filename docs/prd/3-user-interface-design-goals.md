# 3. User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience will be centered on efficiency and clarity. The goal is to create an interface that is clean, uncluttered, and comfortable for daily use. While the aesthetic will be minimalist, the application must capably present data-rich information through clear tables and charts when the user wishes to analyze their finances. The design should feel modern, responsive, and fast.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
The application will follow standard, intuitive web interaction patterns. Core interactions will include:
*   Using simple, clear forms for adding and editing data.
*   Displaying data in sortable tables and lists.
*   Using modals or dedicated pages for focused tasks like adding a transaction.
*   Visualizing data with interactive charts (e.g., hovering to see details).

**Core Screens and Views**
From a product perspective, the following conceptual screens are necessary to deliver the application's value:
*   **Dashboard/Home Page:** An overview screen displaying the balances of all accounts and a high-level summary of recent financial activity.
*   **Transaction View:** A detailed page for viewing, searching, and managing the list of all transactions.
*   **Add/Edit Transaction Form:** A dedicated form (likely a modal for speed) for creating or modifying a transaction.
*   **Account Management Page:** A settings page for creating and managing financial accounts/wallets.
*   **Category Management Page:** A settings page for managing transaction categories.

**Accessibility: WCAG AA**
As a best practice, the application should aim to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This ensures it is usable by the widest possible audience, including those with disabilities. This involves using proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader-friendly markup.

**Branding**
No specific branding guidelines are required. The focus will be on creating a consistent and pleasant visual theme using a limited color palette, clean typography, and consistent spacing. The Architect and UX expert will define these specifics.

**Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**
The application will be designed with a "mobile-first" responsive approach, ensuring it is fully functional and easy to use on a range of screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
