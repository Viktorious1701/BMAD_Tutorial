# 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
*   **Primary Functional Goal:** To build and deploy a functional wallet application that allows a user to create accounts, manually add income and expense transactions, and view a simple, accurate monthly summary of their finances.
*   **Primary Learning Goal:** To successfully utilize the BMad-Method framework for an end-to-end Greenfield project, including the handoffs between the Analyst, PM, Architect, and development agents.
*   **User Experience Goal:** To deliver a clean, comfortable, and intuitive user interface that prioritizes simplicity and speed for core tasks, such as adding a transaction in under 30 seconds.
*   **Technical Goal:** To implement the application using a modern full-stack approach with Next.js and PostgreSQL, deployed via Netlify, aligning with the user's learning objectives and technical constraints.
*   **Project Goal:** To complete all "Must-Have" MVP features within a 2-week development sprint, demonstrating a rapid and efficient development cycle.

**Background Context**
This project was initiated to solve the core problem that many commercial financial tracking apps are overly complex, costly, and raise significant data privacy concerns. The target user—a tech-savvy individual—seeks a transparent alternative where they retain full control over their financial data. This application directly addresses that need by operating on a manual-entry basis, thereby eliminating the requirement to link to live bank accounts.

The core design philosophy is "simplicity as a feature." We are intentionally avoiding feature bloat like investment tracking or advanced forecasting. Instead, we are focusing on perfecting the fundamental user loop: creating accounts, adding transactions, and viewing a clear summary. This focus on a streamlined, private, and free tool is the project's key differentiator and value proposition. The success of this project will be measured not by the quantity of features, but by its daily utility and the user's satisfaction in having a financial tool they fully own and control.
